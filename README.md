["Build Your Own BitTorrent" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/bittorrent/overview).

In this challenge, I'm building a BitTorrent client that's capable of parsing a
.torrent file and downloading a file from a peer. Along the way, learning
about how torrent files are structured, HTTP trackers, BitTorrentâ€™s Peer
Protocol, pipelining and more.

**Note**: Head over to
